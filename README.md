# YoastSEO.js

Text analysis and assessment library in JavaScript. This library can generate interesting metrics about a text and assess these metrics to give you an assessment which can be used to improve the text.

Also included is a preview of the Google search results which can be assessed using the library.

## Installation

You can install YoastSEO.js using npm:

```bash
npm install https://github.com/Yoast/YoastSEO.js#develop
```

## Usage

If you want the complete experience with UI and everything you can use the `App`. You need to have a few HTML elements to make this work: A snippet preview container, a focusKeyword input element and a content input field.

```js
var SnippetPreview = require( "yoastseo" ).SnippetPreview;
var App = require( "yoastseo" ).App;

window.onload = function() {
	var focusKeywordField = document.getElementById( "focusKeyword" );
	var contentField = document.getElementById( "content" );

	var snippetPreview = new SnippetPreview({
		targetElement: document.getElementById( "snippet" )
	});

	var app = new App({
		snippetPreview: snippetPreview,
		targets: {
			output: "output"
		},
		callbacks: {
			getData: function() {
				return {
					keyword: focusKeywordField.value,
					text: contentField.value
				};
			}
		}
	});

	app.refresh();
	
	focusKeywordField.addEventListener( 'change', app.analyzeTimer.bind( app ) );
	contentField.addEventListener( 'change', app.analyzeTimer.bind( app ) );
};
```

You can also invoke internal components directly to be able to work with the raw data. To get metrics about the text you can use the `Researcher`:

```js
var Researcher = require( "yoastseo" ).Researcher;

var researcher = new Researcher( new Paper( "Text that has been written" ) );

console.log( researcher.getResearch( "wordCountInText" ) );
```
