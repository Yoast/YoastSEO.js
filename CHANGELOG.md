	* findKeywordInFirstParagraph
	* findKeywordInPageTitle
	* getKeywordDensity
	* getLinks
	* getLinkStatistics
	* imageAltTags
	* imageCountInText

### Backwards incompatible changes

* Passing the title, url and meta description meant for the snippet editor is no longer taken into account. The snippet
editor keeps track of these values itself.
* `callbacks.updateSnippetValues` has been deprecated in favor of `callback.saveSnippetData`. Currently a raw event is
passed to `updateSnippetValues`. This is undesirable because it couples the callback to the DOM. The new
`saveSnippetData` passes the actual data that the user put in the fields.
* The `SnippetPreview` object now requires an options object instead of an `App` object. The `App` object should still be passed inside the options object with the `analyzerApp` key.

	* Add progress bars to show an indication about the length of the title and meta description.
	* Add carets before the preview and form fields to show which preview belongs to which input field.
* Introduce modules. All non-trivial modules are moved out of `analyzer.js` and moved to the `analyses` folder as module. Where it makes sense we added a `stringProcessing` folder with all the string helper modules.
* Introduces new SnippetPreview functions:
	* toggleEditor
	* closeEditor
	* openEditor
	* updateDataFromDOM
	* changedInput
	* bindEvents
	* updateProgressBars
	* validateFields
	* callRegisteredEventBinder
	* getAnalyzerData
	* refresh
	* renderTemplate
